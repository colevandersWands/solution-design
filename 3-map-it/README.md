a powerful problem solving method: MAPPING

the idea behind mapping is to solve an easier problem that works like your problem.

to do this, you figure out how you can map your possible inputs into a new format that is easier to manipulate and that will behave the same as the original arguments

then you define a function to map from inputs to this new set

solve the problem easilier in this new set

then map the solution back onto the desired outputs

=> mapping & demapping


it will feel like you're doing extra work, and you are
but it's good work an outstanding skill you're practicing

it will feel strange at first 
and you will not at all feel like you're solving the problem you want to
and the data you're working with will feel so strange and abstract
but that's the point

remember: 
	the main objective here is not to solve the problems in the simplest or prettiest way
	it is to practice solving challenges by mapping their values into another set
	solving an analogous problem in that new space
	and mapping the solution back to the original problem space

if you do this right, the mapping/demapping will be harder than solving the problem
and solving the problem with your mapping will be at least as easy as without
