		chunking doesn't quite work
		baaad for first step
		mixing concerns - 'variable names'
	very first examples
		clear completed example
		2-3 highly curated ones to study
		people won't really run off and do sooo many
	label bastards as such
		they shall be illuminatingly difficult
	stages of curation
		from easy & worked

	can i mimick this in js with constraints?
		could make a neat stand-alone course

debugging
	empirical style
	exercises
	pr's 

extreme exercise
	manual code styling in word

analyzing data
	more like data STRATEGIES
	snippet-study-ish thing
		data structure
		operations allowed
		when/how useful
		an example implemented in JS
