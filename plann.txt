line this up with fcc Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures 
	it's good 
	and huge
	and popular
	but not complete
		it needs us

	can i mimick this in js with constraints?
		could make a neat stand-alone course

structure
	self-testing objects, mvclh, ...
	can all be done as addons once pytut/replit/inspector work is done
	only as part of embedding in ui's

are a,b,c,d's md's in the main exercise repo?
	some yes, some no. but all linked to as resources therein
	some have exercises, some don't

repos have
	this is somewhere in a folder up there

using parsons
	make expansions// example pages as comptation & expansions challenges
	and with the tables
	then they do the codeing bit as work
	and have this as a reference and exercise list

staple of open course

code reviews
	for peer grading?
	haven't 'passed' a step till it's been reviewed
	give clear guidelines
	a whole repo on this is due

creating exercises
	where/how to fit this?

debugging
	empirical style
	exercises
	pr's 

fcc
	how to sync with f'al & oop
	fcc folder for fcc exercises?

extreme exercise
	manual code styling in word

analyzing data
	more like data STRATEGIES
	snippet-study-ish thing
		data structure
