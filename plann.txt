more highly-curated examples
	ie. TheNewStyles
		chunking doesn't quite work
		baaad for first step
		mixing concerns - 'variable names'
	very first examples
		clear completed example
		2-3 highly curated ones to study
		people won't really run off and do sooo many
	label bastards as such
		they shall be illuminatingly difficult
	stages of curation
		from easy & worked
